# Simple.KYC ðŸ¤”
 
 This is a simple proof of concept work to demostrate ["know your customer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer#:~:text=The%20know%20your%20customer%20or,Money%20Laundering%20(AML)%20policy.) topic. The main objective of this repository is to learn, how can we create a businessa and real-life solutions with current software and open-source technologies in a short time. And also to learn new technologies as ASP.NET Core Blazor, Azure Cognitive Services.
 
 In this repository, our scenario is very simple. Let's say we have just a person's photo(Ex. ID Photo...) and his/her name and want to learn about her/his social media profile.
 
 This is done with a joy to learn new tech-stacks such as;
 
 - ASP.NET Core Blazor(Server-side) - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor
 - Azure Cognitive Services - Face API - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/
 - Azure Cognitive Services - Text Analytics API - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/
 - Tweetini API - https://github.com/linvi/tweetinvi
 
 
 Let's say that we have a photo of a person and name. We are looking him/her social profile if exists, so we search according the name and photo. In this example, Twitter's Search API(s) are used to verify photo of the person with her/his social account photo.

Let's check person's tweets and analyse tweets for key phrases. And see what he/she is talking about...

As I said this is a very very basic proof of concept work to demostrate some software techologies.

Happy coding... ðŸ˜€
